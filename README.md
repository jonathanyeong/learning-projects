# Learning Projects

This repo contains a list of all my learning projects.

> [!NOTE]
> *What's a learning project?* It's a tiny short-lived project that has a specific learning goal. A finished learning project does not have to be
a functioning project.

The goal of learning projects is to build a library of commonly used patterns and components to help speed up development
on larger projects.

## Commonly used commands

Setting up new Rails app

```bash
rails-new -u 3.4.1 -r 8.0.1 <app-name> --devcontainer --css tailwind
```
